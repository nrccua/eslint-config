# ESLint Config

Encoura's preferred configs for TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, CommitLint, and
MarkdownLint.

## Getting Started

Install this package, [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), and
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) as dev dependencies:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @encoura/eslint-config husky lint-staged
```

Configure husky by adding the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
...
"scripts": {
  ...
  "prepare": "husky",
  ...
},
...
```

## Configure CommitLint

To configure [CommitLint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint), create a
`commitlint.config.js` file in the root of your project that contains the
following:

```js
module.exports = require('@encoura/eslint-config/commitlint.config');
```

This will allow CommitLint to discover the configuration this repository
provides from within your `node_modules` folder.

By default the Encoura commitlint expects a commit message in the following format:

`[XXX-###]: Subject` where XXX-### is a jira ticket id, e.g., `E4E-1`

The commit message may also be in the form of git's standard merge commit format.

## Configure ESLint

To configure [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), add the following to your
`.eslintrc.js` and `package.json` files. This will allow ESLint to discover the
configuration this repository provides from within your `node_modules` folder,
and will check your `*.js`, `*.ts`, and `*.tsx` files for infractions every
time you create a new commit:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    // For front-end (React / Next.js) projects:
    '@encoura/eslint-config'
    // For back-end (Nest.js) projects:
    '@encoura/eslint-config/nest'
  ]
  ...
  // Add any custom rules/plugins/configuration here
}
```

```json
...
"lint-staged": {
  ...
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "eslint",
  ...
},
...
```

## Configure MarkdownLint

To configure [MarkdownLint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), add the
following to your `package.json` file. This will allow MarkdownLint to discover
the configuration this repository provides from within your `node_modules`
folder, and will check your `*.md` files for infractions every time you create
a new commit:

```json
...
"lint-staged": {
  ...
  "*.{md}": "markdownlint --config node_modules/@encoura/eslint-config/markdownlint.config.json",
  ...
},
...
```

## Configure Prettier

To configure [prettier](https://prettier.io/), create a `.prettierrc.js`
file in the root of your project that contains the following:

```js
module.exports = require('@encoura/eslint-config/prettier.config');
```

This will allow Prettier to discover the configuration this repository
provides from within your `node_modules` folder.

Next, add the following to your `package.json` file so that prettier will check
your files for infractions every time you create a new commit:

```json
...
"lint-staged": {
  ...
  "*.{js,jsx,json,md,ts,tsx}": [
    "prettier --write",
    "git add"
  ]
  ...
},
...
```

## Configure TypeScript

To configure [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), add the following
to your `tsconfig.json` file. This will allow TypeScript to discover the
configuration this repository provides from within your `node_modules` folder:

```json
...
"extends": "node_modules/@encoura/eslint-config/tsconfig.json",
...
```

## Local Development

### npm Scripts

There are several npm scripts at your disposal during local development.
Here are some of the more important ones:

| Script   | Description    |
| :------- | :------------- |
| npm test | Run all tests. |

### Release Process

When your code changes are ready, it's time to publish a new patch, minor, or
major release.

1. Make a PR (or mark your draft PR as ready for review).

2. Annotate your PR with the necessary context to let Semantic Release know if
   this should yield a new patch, minor, or major release:

   - If you expect the merging of your PR to result in a new _patch_ release,
     start your PR title with `fix:`.
   - If you expect the merging of your PR to result in a new _minor_ release,
     start your PR title with `feat:`.
   - If you expect the merging of your PR to result in a new _major_ release,
     see #3 below for details.
   - If you expect the merging of your PR to skip the creation of a new release,
     you can start your PR title with `build:` (for build changes),
     `chore:` (for basic maintenance), `docs:` (for documentation updates),
     or simply do not use any of the above keyword prefixes.

3. If the pull request should create a new major version release, the string
   `BREAKING CHANGE:` must be included in at least one commit message's
   **footer** ([see docs](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release#commit-message-format))
   â€” Semantic Release's commit analyzer does **not** use the PR title in
   determining major releases.

   You can either manually add `BREAKING CHANGE:` to the commit footer
   after pressing "Merge Pull Request"/"Squash and Merge" in your PR (in the
   "optional extended description" field). Alternatively, if you're merging the
   PR by creating a new merge commit, ensure that at least one of the source
   commits' messages has `BREAKING CHANGE:` in its footer. Note that to
   accomplish this you may need to commit with the `--no-verify` flag to bypass
   commitlint.

4. Once your PR is merged, Semantic Release will pick it up and initiate the
   automated release process. If it detects that it should create a release
   (based on the above), it will. Otherwise, it won't!
